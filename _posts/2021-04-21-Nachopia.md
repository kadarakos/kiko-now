## Tomato sauce

Saute two cloves of garlic and a medium onion on olive oil until nice. When its nice add chopped tomatoes.
Season with salt, pepper, pepperoncino and thai coconut curry powder. Cook it until its cooked.
Blend it. Season with balsamico, sambal, lemon pepper and cilantro.

## Cheese sauce

Saute the mushrooms and when its nice add canned corn and green olives. Season with cumin powder, Hungarian paprika powder,
and pepper. Add the bag of TexMex Cheese mix and mix it in until it becomes a goo. 

## Nacho

Layer nacho --> cheese sauce --> ... --> nacho --> cheese sauce on top of each other in a glass bowl. Top it off with a thin
layer of tomato sauce. Oven/Microwave it until its nice. We just ate it out of the ball and keep lathering it with the Tomatoe sauce. 
We suggest a Caipiroska with it. Enjoy!
