## The Aubergine

Cut the Indian (mini) Eggplants in half. Season with lemonpepper, pepper, salt and chiliflakes. Drizzle olive oil and oveeeeen it nice.

## Mushrooms:

Saute the mushrooms simply with butter and garlic.

## Yoghourt:

Season Greek yoghurt with mint, lemonjuice salt and pepper.

## Halloumi

Just saute the halloumi, thats it.

## Bruschetta:

Drizzle oil on some nice bread. rub garlic on it, drizzle more oil and oveeen it!

## The Reveal

By now you must be wondering how to compose these tasty phrases into a harmonious haiku. 
First of all put the mushrooms on the bruschetta. Place the yoghurt and jam on the table as dipping sauces.
We recommend dipping to halloumi 80% of the times into the jam and 20% into yoghourt. The aurbegine only goes
well with the yoghurt. That's it. Mushrooms on toast with jammy halloumi and yoghourty aurbegine. Its nice.
