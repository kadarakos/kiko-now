After kundalini yoga it feels pleasant to eat something that is tasty
yet inoffensive. Spicy yet mellow. Mushy with bursts of texture. Eat
it on the couch with your Twin Flame and after every three bite mention
how cool you guys are cooking so late after going to yoga together.

Ingredients
-------------

```
- Rice
- Rice milk
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Chili flakes
- Tempeh
- Frozen Peas
- Eggs
``` 

Method
------------

### Tempeh

Heat up olive oil in the pan, then add the Tempeh. 
Crank the mofo to the max and then in about 2-3 minutes add the spices:
chili flakes, ginger and garlic. Garlic I chop small. The ginger I 
enjoy in longer strips more; its always nice surprise to find a big chunk.  

### Rice

While the Tempeh is cooking with the spices start cooking the Rice.
Just like normal people would do it: add salt to the water, boil it and 
add the rice. When its almost done add the frozen peas.


### Strange Sauce

Now let's prepare the strange mixture: beat up 2-3 eggs and add
Rice Milk to it. 


### The Finale

Turn the heat off under the pan where the 
Tempeh is cooking and add the Rice + Pea combo to it. Pour the strange
mixture on top of this stuff and add additional Rice Milk to create the 
amount of mushiness you are looking for in your life at that particular
moment.

That's it, hope you'll enjoy it!
