As an effort to maintain the
lack of their chiseled bodies with home workouts
the Twin Flames wondered: what is left to enjoy in this 
COVID-19 ridden world? The answer is obviously: Butternut Squash.
(I also just wanted to eat something vegan that doesn't
make me fart very bad.)


Ingredients
-------------

```
- Butternut Squash
- Nice bread
- Thyme
- Garlic
- Salt'n'Peppa
- Optional: hummus
``` 

Method
------------

### Butternut Squash

Put the Squash on a baking tray and drizzle olive oil on it.
Massage it hard with salt then crack a tiny bit of black pepper 
on it. Place it in the oven for some time on some appropriate heat.
When already kinda cooked, but not charred, add quite a bit of thyme.
Bake it until its nice and charred and tasty.

### Bread

Oil up the bread, schmeeer some garlic on it and throw some thyme 
leaves at it. Finish it up with some salt. Oven it until it looks
tasty.

### The Finale

Peel the Squash and cut it into beautiful slivers or glowing 
orange goodness. Place it on your nicest plate along with the
bread. My twin flame is a purist and enjoys the it with the
crunchy bread, but I like to add hummus into the mix.
Enjoy!
