title: Aubergine Pâté Extraordinaire
---

The most exquisite Aubergine Pâté you've ever had.

Ingredients
---------------

- Aubergine
- Butter
- Olive oil
- Sun flower seeds
- Miso
- Salt'n'Peppa
- Garlic

----------------

Start by poking holes in the Aubergine, cutting it in half and score the flesh.
Mix like half a table spoon of miso with table spoon of rice vinegar in a small bowl and set it aside.
Place the Aubergine skin down in a super hot pan. Char it hard then flip it. 
Wait until the flesh gets brown then add a nob of butter and some garlic and cover it with a lid.
Let it go like this for a while then flip it back and schmeeer it with the miso mixture.
When its nice and soft sear it hard in the oven. I don't like to throw the skin out, so if you
managed to char it, but not burn it, then chop the whole thing up and put it in a food processor.
Blend it up and add miso, salt and pepper to taste. Schmeeer it on whatever!
