The Lakora Ketchup is something the Twin Flames indulge on from time to time.
We usually eat it with brunch style stuff like fluffy eggs Â´n such. Its incredibly
simple to make and it tastes very close to ketchup.


Ingredients
-------------
```
- Cherry tomatoes
- Balsamic vinegar
- Sugar
- Salt
- Olive oil
```

### Here we go

Here is the whole thing:

1. Heat olive oil in a pen.
2. Put the full cherry tomatoes in it.
3. Add salt and sugar.
4. When the cherry tomatoes are "melting" add the Balsamic vingar.
5. When soft enough you can mush them around.
6. Cook it until its more thick.

### ... and done!
