evening.

-------------

```
- Parsnip
- Beey root
- Dried cranberry
- Mint
- Couscous
- Butter
- Balsamic vinegar
- Salt'n'Peppa
``` 

Method
------------

### Roots

Put the parsnip and beetroot chunks on a baking tray 
and drizzle olive oil on them. Hit them with a nice amount of 
salt and black pepper. Oven them until they turn into
something pretty craveable.

### Cranberry flare

On kinda low heat, melt some butter and let the cranberries enjoy
a nice bubbly butter bath. Give it some balsamic vinegar and let
the whole mixture be reabsorbed into the dried cranberries. When
you feel like its done shower it with mint leaves.

### Couscous

Cook some nice pearl couscous and cheat with a small amount
of vegetable stock powder.


### The End

When its all ready smush it together. Enjoy!
