title: Bee Watcher's Salad
---

Eating this dish from a bowl, while watching the ever busy
bee workers buzzing around in your garden makes for a divine Saturday afternoon.
To make this wonderful meal for your twin-flame, you must prepare four simple 
components and then ensemble them together.

# Ingredients

- Quinoa
- Spinach
- Mushroom
- Thyme
- Lemon 
- Tomatoe
- Balsamic vinegar
- Sugar, salt, pepper
- Tofu
- Soy sauce

## 1. Super tomatoes

First cut up the tomatoes to tomato-salad-compatible chunks (I kinda like semi-circles).
Put the chunks in a bowl. Mix olive oil, salt, sugar, pepper and balsamic vinegar together
in a small cup. Balance the flavours such that its super tasty, but not too sweet or acidic.
Pour this vinegrette on the tomatoes, mix it all up and toss it in the fridge. 

## 2. Lively shroomies

Saute button mushrooms on olive oil until they are hard golden. When they are done throw then in a bowl.
Add coarse sea salt, thyme leaves and a bit of lemon juice. Put it in the fridge to chill together with the
super tomatoes.

## 3. Tofu
