title: Bee Watcher's Salad
---

Watching the ever busy
bee workers buzzing around in your garden makes for a divine Saturday afternoon.
I had a wonderful time enjoying this salad with my twin flame, 
observing the tiny creatures exectuting their protocol.
First you will prepare four simple components and then ensemble them together.

# Ingredients

- Pearl Cous
- Spinach
- Mushroom
- Thyme
- Lemon 
- Tomatoe
- Balsamic vinegar
- Sesame oil
- Sugar, salt, pepper
- Tofu
- Soy sauce

## 1. Super tomatoes

First cut up the tomatoes to tomato-salad-compatible chunks (I kinda like semi-circles).
Put the chunks in a bowl. Mix olive oil, salt, sugar, pepper and balsamic vinegar together
in a small cup. Balance the flavours such that its super tasty, but not too sweet or acidic.
Pour this vinegrette on the tomatoes, mix it all up and toss it in the fridge. 

## 2. Lively shroomies

Saute button mushrooms on olive oil until they are hard golden. When they are done throw then in a bowl.
Add coarse sea salt, thyme leaves and a bit of lemon juice. Put it in the fridge to chill together with the
super tomatoes.

## 3. Tofu

Arguably even less challenging than the Lively shroomies: sear the tofu hard on olive oil, add soy sauce,
sesame oil and a bit of lemon. Donezo!

## 4. Pearl Couscous

Cook the pearl couscous until it has a consistency that you feel like consuming.

## 5. Ensemble

Drum roll, ... , aaaand we are at the final stage already. Place a half moon shape from the pearl couscous on the plate.
Fill the half moon up with super tomatoes and tofu. Place the lively shroomies on the couscous and tuck some raw spinach 
here and there between the side of the bowl and other ingredients. Enjoy!
